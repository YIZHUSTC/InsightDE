# Insight Data Engineering Project
## Project idea
This project is proposed to monitor current and track historical traffic information for the purpose of providing better suggetions for a coming travel route.
## Use cases
Suggest the potential route with shortest traveling time based on current and historical traffic flow.<br>
Identify spots with frequent traffic incidents based on historical traffic data, and help to avoid those spots on route in some certain cases.
## Technologies to be used
Traffic data:<br>
Here Traffic API: https://developer.here.com/documentation/traffic/topics/what-is.html<br>
Real-time streaming:<br>
Spark Streaming<br>
Kafka<br>
redis/cassandra<br>
PostgreSQL<br>
## Proposed architecture

The idea of this project is to help suggesting the bid price of properties based on estimated and final sold price by obtaining historical data of similar real estate
## Use cases
Track historical sold price of specific properties<br>
Suggest how much the buyers should bid (overbid or underbid)
## Technologies to be used
Redfin API<br>
Spark Streaming<br>
cassandra<br>
PostgreSQL<br>
